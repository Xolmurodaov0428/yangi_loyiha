# Fix: Add Organization Map Not Working

## 🐛 Problem

When adding a new organization:
- Map displays ✅
- But search doesn't work ❌
- Clicking on map doesn't work ❌
- Address doesn't get saved ❌

---

## ✅ Solution

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Added Console Logging**

Now you can see what's happening in browser console (F12):

```javascript
console.log('Add map initialized');
console.log('Map clicked at:', e.latlng);
console.log('Searching for:', query);
console.log('Search results:', data);
console.log('Address set to:', data[0].display_name);
```

**How to use:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Yangi tashkilot qo'shish"
3. Try searching or clicking map
4. Watch console for messages
5. See if any errors appear

---

#### 2. **Updated Address Fields**

When you click on map or search, both fields update:

```javascript
// Both fields now update
document.getElementById('addressInput').value = data.display_name;  // Hidden field
document.getElementById('addressSearch').value = data.display_name; // Search box
```

**Benefit:** You can see the address that will be saved

---

#### 3. **Better Error Handling**

```javascript
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Search error:', error);
    alert('Xatolik yuz berdi. Iltimos qayta urinib ko\'ring.');
});
```

**Benefit:** Clear error messages if something goes wrong

---

#### 4. **Input Validation**

```javascript
if (!query || query.trim() === '') {
    alert('Iltimos, manzilni kiriting');
    return;
}
```

**Benefit:** Prevents empty searches

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If search doesn't work:

**Open Console (F12) and check for:**

```javascript
// Should see:
"Searching for: Toshkent IT Park"
"Search results: [{...}]"
"Moving map to: 41.xxx, 69.xxx"
"Address set to: ..."

// If you see errors:
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null"
→ Element ID mismatch

"NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource"
→ Internet connection issue

"Search results: []"
→ Location not found, try different query
```

---

### If map click doesn't work:

**Check Console for:**

```javascript
// Should see when clicking:
"Map clicked at: {lat: 41.xxx, lng: 69.xxx}"
"Reverse geocoded: ..."
"Address set to: ..."

// If nothing appears:
→ Map not initialized properly
→ Click event not attached
→ Check for JavaScript errors above
```
